# Product Manager Interview Assignment

Evaluates the candidate’s ability to understand user needs, prioritize features, and create a strategic roadmap for an IoT platform.

Scenario:
Your company offers an IoT platform with features including dashboarding, device management, data visualization, and alerting.
A key client has approached you with the following request:
- Background: The client is a smart city organization managing streetlights, traffic systems, and environmental sensors. They need an intuitive and scalable IoT solution to monitor and manage these devices efficiently.
- Requirements:
  - Centralized dashboards for monitoring multiple device types (lights, traffic signals, sensors).
  - Role-based access for city officials and operators.
  - Alerts and notifications for maintenance and unusual device behavior.
  - Data analytics for environmental sensor readings (e.g., pollution levels, temperature).
  - Scalability to handle millions of devices as the smart city grows.

Tasks:
1. Feature Prioritization: From the requirements above, identify and prioritize the top 3 features for an MVP (Minimum Viable Product). Explain your reasoning based on user needs and business impact.
2. User Journey Mapping: Create a user journey for a city operator logging in, viewing sensor data, and receiving a maintenance alert for a malfunctioning streetlight.
3. Wireframe Design: Sketch a wireframe (can be rough or low-fidelity) for the centralized dashboard. Highlight key features and UI components.
4. Roadmap Development: Develop a 6-month roadmap for the platform, including the MVP release and iterative updates. Explain how each phase addresses client needs and aligns with business goals.
5. Scalability Proposal: Provide a high-level strategy to ensure scalability and performance as the number of devices increases. You can include architectural or feature-specific recommendations.
6. Success Metrics: Define 3 key success metrics for the platform’s adoption and performance within the first year of deployment.

## Deliverables:
- A document or presentation covering the tasks above.
- Optional: Any additional insights or innovations the candidate feels would enhance the platform.

## Evaluation Criteria:
- Understanding of IoT platforms and user needs.
- Clarity and logic in prioritization and roadmap planning.
- Creativity and practicality in feature design and user journey.
- Awareness of scalability and technical considerations.
- Ability to define measurable success criteria.
